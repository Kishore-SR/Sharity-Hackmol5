## About Hackmol 5.0 - Hackathon ðŸš€
HackMol 5.0 is fifth-edition of community-focused 30-hour hackathon organized by DSC NIT Jalandhar. The participants must develop an idea and submit the PPT on the Devfolio Platform. The selected student would be invited to join Round 2 taking Place offline at NIT Jalandhar.

From over 4000+ participants across the country, our team "COSMIC" was among the top 50 teams selected for Round 2 after presenting our idea "Sharity" in the initial online submission Round 1.

**Although we didn't make it to the top 3, we learned a lot!**
- Work distribution: Shared tasks well among us. 
- Team building: Became a stronger team together.
- Product pitching: Got better at explaining our idea.
